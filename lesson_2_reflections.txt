What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I need to commit so that I can choose which files to commit and also to add a comment.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I edit files in the working directory.  I can use the staging directory to group files into a single commit - files that are logically related for a given change.
