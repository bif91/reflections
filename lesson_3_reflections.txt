When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I could use a remote repository to share files and code with other people or to have a remote backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes in the repository could be made by other people, and may not be compatible (without appropriate merge) with the changes in my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a branch in github.  A branch maintains history for all commits.  A clone is a copy without any link to the original (updates in each are separate).
